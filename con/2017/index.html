What if we erase this distinction between inputs and outputs, and only think about the <em>relationships</em> between these values?  We end up with <em>relational</em> programming, which lets us run our programs backwards: we can infer the “input” values that produce a desired “output” value.  We can also reorder our code arbitrarily, without changing the meaning of our programs.  By writing an interpreter for a subset of Racket using this approach, the interpreter inherits the ability to synthesize Racket programs from example inputs and outputs, among other interesting abilities.</p><p>We will demonstrate all of these features using <a href="http://minikanren.org/">miniKanren</a>, a domain-specific language for constraint logic programming that is itself embedded in Racket.</p></div><div class="bio"><p><img src="dfried.jpg"/> <a href="https://www.cs.indiana.edu/~dfried/">Daniel P.

The approach develops the functions for one-dimensional movement both for exact motion and inexact motion. One-dimensional particle systems are introduced and then the model is extended for the full Kalman filtering algorithms using matrices. In the process, students learn how to develop physical models for their objects using standard trignometric and algebraic ideas.

Submodules and RackUnit make simple unit tests easy and quick to write, even in an unfamiliar codebase. But Racket’s testing story has more than a few holes when it comes to more complex tests. This talk discusses the current state of Racket’s testing ecosystem and presents a toolkit of packages to improve it. The toolkit packages add support for unit testing side effects with mocks, integration testing with fixtures, and abstracting over tests with composable first-class assertions. The packages are for the most part independent but designed to work together, and are built on top of a few general purpose libraries that can be used for non-testing purposes. There’s far more work to be done however, and this talk highlights what other forms of testing aspiring Racketeers ought to write packages for so I don’t have to.</p><div class="bio"><a href="https://github.com/jackfirth">Jack Firth</a> is a software engineer at Google, primarily working on Google’s continuous integration and testing infrastructure and platforms.

For my most recent offering, I rewrote all of the tools in Racket (with 55% less code, including an extensive test-suite and more features!)

A syntax checker detects common syntax misconception errors in individual subexpressions to guide students to partial solutions that can be evaluated for the semantic correctness. A mutation-based approach is then used to generate hints for almost-correct programs. If the mutation-based approach fails, a case analyzer detects missing program branches to guide students to partial solutions with reasonable structures. Our system itself is implemented in Racket. We utilize Rosette, a solver-aided language embedded in Racket, as a constraint solver to prove program equivalence.</p><p>After analyzing over 75,000 program submissions and 8,789 hint requests from UC Berkeley’s introductory computer science course, we found that using all three techniques together could offer hints for any program, no matter how far it was from a correct solution. Furthermore, our analysis shows that hints contributed to students’ progress while still encouraging the students to solve problems by themselves.</p><div class="bio"><a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~mangpo/www/home.html">Phitchaya Mangpo Phothilimthana</a> is a PhD student from UC Berkeley working with Professor Ras Bodik.

I’ll describe how I’ve been teaching the course by having students code a small proof assistant (Proust) in Racket and using it to do their homework. Its construction proceeds in stages through propositional and predicate logic, going as far as recursive functions on natural numbers before a lateral transition to Coq.</p><div class="bio"><a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~plragde/">Prabhakar Ragde</a> has been a professor of Computer Science at the University of Waterloo since 1988.

It started with the goal of introducing everyone to the wonderful world of program design, with a spirit of full inclusion and no emphasis on any specific group.  Over time it has grown into a full-fledged professional community with a well-known reputation for helpfulness and openness on its on-line communication channels. The organizers want to encourage an equally open exchange of ideas at RacketCon, the community’s in-person meet-up.</p><p>This spirit requires an environment that enables all to participate without fear of personal harassment. We define harassment as unwelcome or hostile behavior, that is, behavior that focuses on people instead of ideas. <a href="http://www.acm.org/sigs/volunteer_resources/officers_manual/anti-harassment-policy">The ACM’s anti-harassment policy</a> lists a variety of specific unacceptable factors and behaviors. The organizers consider responses such as “just joking,” or “teasing,” or being “playful” as unacceptable.</p><p>Anyone witnessing or subject to unacceptable behavior should notify one of the RacketCon organizers (Matthew Flatt, Vincent St-Amour).</p><p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, from a warning of the offender to an expulsion from the conference [without refund].</p><p>[The wording of this policy is directly derived from <a href="http://snapl.org/2015/policy.html">that of the SNAPL conference</a>, with thanks.]</p><h3>Previous RacketCons</h3><div><con><a href="http://con.racket-lang.org/2016">2016</a></con><con><a href="http://con.racket-lang.org/2015">2015</a></con><con><a href="http://con.racket-lang.org/2014">2014</a></con><con><a href="http://con.racket-lang.org/2013">2013</a></con><con><a href="http://con.racket-lang.org/2012">2012</a></con><con><a href="http://con.racket-lang.org/2011">2011</a></con></div><div style="height: 2rem"></div><p><em>“Everyone has a universe of beautiful things in their head.
