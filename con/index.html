We believe Racket is well positioned to meet a wide variety of people in-between these groups.  Morgan will present on our use of Racket for non-programmers.  Using Racket, Dr. Racket, and Scribble, we have run a series of successful workshops on “programmable publishing”.  Although these were marketed to humanities students, this method can be applied to a wide variety of disciplines including the social sciences and mathematics.  It can be applied outside of the university for creative writing, community outreach, and other populations with publishing needs.  The common thread through these communities is users who don’t view themselves as programmers or who would like to program but don’t think they have the ability or resources to learn.  Because of its accessibility, we use scribble as a gateway into basic programming skills where participants can apply their fledgling skills to a practical output that relates to their daily lives.  Chris will present on Racket for the general programmer.  Racket is as batteries-included as Python and is well set up to be just as general.  How can we reach a general audience?  What can we gain by doing so?</p><div class="bio"><strong>Christopher Lemmer Webber</strong> is a user freedom advocate with who focuses on network freedom.

Topics range from: robotics, game design, web design, virtual reality, Java, Python, physical computing, and Minecraft modding.  Why so many topics?  That’s what the market wants, so that’s what we provide.  In 2018, I took on the seemingly impossible challenge of unifying all our topics under a single language of instruction.  That language was Racket.  This talk reports on our use of Racket and Racket-embedded DSLs to teach a broad spectrum of computing topics.</p><p>Due to the resounding success of our Racket pivot, I’m convinced that Racket is an educational power-tool for computer science education.  I used to say that my mission was to teach coding to every child in the world.  I can now confidently refine that mission: I want to teach Racket to every child in the world.  This talk outlines the growth vision for ThoughtSTEM–a vision that will bring broad-spectrum Racket-based education beyond San Diego and into 20 more major American cities by the end of 2022.  Ultimately, I want to see DrRacket on every computer in America, as a basic tool that everybody knows how to use–as familiar and useful as a web browser or a word processor.  Can we make this happen?  I think we can.</p><div class="bio"><strong>Stephen R.

Written in Racket for Racket and more, one can write plugins in Racket to extend its functionalities. This plugin system is very general, but this comes at a cost: the development time is significant even for small functionalities, and requires to restart DrRacket at every change. For a large range of small scripts, Quickscript (formerly the Script Plugin) allows to write simple (and not so simple) scripts for DrRacket without needing to restart it and with much smaller development time, even making it possible to write short-lived scripts for single purposes. Sharing scripts written with Quickscript is as simple as sharing a code snippet.</p><div class="bio">After years of self-taught programming in Pascal, BASIC and C, <strong>Laurent Orseau</strong> learned PLT Scheme (Racket’s name at the time) as an undergrad.

He stuck with it ever since, through 7 years in academia at AgroParisTech (France) and even now as a research scientist at DeepMind (London, UK), despite the supremacy of other mainstream languages in his environment.

The students were dissatisfied with Racket-like teaching languages.

It’s about solving problems by making languages; language-oriented programming is the name of the game. The idea has an immediate intuitive appeal. Perhaps it’s what drove you to Racket in the first place. And if it wasn’t, chances are good, if you stick around the community for a while, that you’ll find yourself thinking about languages.</p><p>But what are we talking about when we talk about “language-oriented programming”? Looking around the Racket community &amp; among its fellow travelers, one finds that “make your own language” has a variety of senses. Although some common core ideas can be enumerated, they get expressed in different ways. At times, one wonders: are we all talking about the same thing?</p><p>To help foster the growth of language-oriented programming in general—and Racket in particular as the best environment for solving problems in that way—it’s important that we understand the diversity of meanings of “language-oriented programming” and kindred expressions. A good place to help develop that understanding is the Racket community itself and its principal drivers. Here I present the results of a survey of core Racket developers about what “make your own language” means to them.</p><div class="bio"><strong>Jesse Alama</strong> counts himself lucky for having been exposed early in life to Scheme. After enjoying Common Lisp for several years, he wanted something new; he flirted with Clojure but then settled on Racket a few years ago and has never looked back.

Using places we can set up independent services that communicate via channels. Often state machines are used in this setting to model session state, resource allocation, or service start order. However, plain state machines often suffer from the explosion of the state space as soon as multiple state variables appear in combination. Also some applications have only an infinite representation, if modeled as a state machine.</p><p>In this talk, we address these challenges by introducing pnet, a Racket library that allows to define Racket places as Petri nets. Petri nets are a class of transition systems representing state as tokens produced and consumed by transitions. We consider several examples for Petri nets as Racket places such as a worker pool and consider the possibility of driving the pnet library from a tailor-made DSL or using it to construct distributed programming languages.</p><div class="bio"><strong>Jörgen Brandt</strong> is a PhD student based in Berlin.

It started with the goal of introducing everyone to the wonderful world of program design, with a spirit of full inclusion and no emphasis on any specific group.  Over time it has grown into a full-fledged professional community with a well-known reputation for helpfulness and openness on its on-line communication channels. The organizers want to encourage an equally open exchange of ideas at RacketCon, the community’s in-person meet-up.</p><p>This spirit requires an environment that enables all to participate without fear of personal harassment. We define harassment as unwelcome or hostile behavior, that is, behavior that focuses on people instead of ideas. <a href="http://www.acm.org/sigs/volunteer_resources/officers_manual/anti-harassment-policy">The ACM’s anti-harassment policy</a> lists a variety of specific unacceptable factors and behaviors. The organizers consider responses such as “just joking,” or “teasing,” or being “playful” as unacceptable.</p><p>Anyone witnessing or subject to unacceptable behavior should notify one of the RacketCon organizers (Matthew Flatt or Jay McCarthy.)</p><p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, from a warning of the offender to an expulsion from the conference [without refund].</p><p>[The wording of this policy is directly derived from <a href="http://snapl.org/2015/policy.html">that of the SNAPL conference</a>, with thanks.]</p><h3>Sponsoring</h3><p>If you would like to sponsor, please contact the <a href="http://mailto:jay.mccarthy@gmail.com">organizers</a>.

The heat and exhaustion was unbearable and I felt that I could not move any longer. At the last moment before collapse, my fingers just barely touched something cold and solid. I stumbled forward and grasped at it with all my being. It was a door knob. When I opened the door, I stumbled through and felt a cool comfort that was indescribable in the moment. When my eyes acclimatized to my new surroundings, I realized that I was at RacketCon.”</em></p><p>—Satisfied Customer, RacketCon 2017</p></div>
