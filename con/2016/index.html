It extends Racket with a few constructs that make it easy to build advanced tools for program verification and synthesis. Building these tools usually takes months or years of work, as well as expertise in many fields, from formal methods to programming languages to software engineering. With Rosette, creating such a tool is as easy as defining a new domain-specific language in Racket. Once you define your language, you get the tools for (almost) free. This talk will provide a brief introduction to Rosette, concluding with a whirlwind tour of recent applications to finding bugs in radiotherapy software, generating efficent code for ultra low-power hardware, and creating custom tutors for K-12 algebra.</p><div class="bio"><a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~emina/index.html">Emina Torlak</a>  is an assistant professor at the University of Washington.

Because making my own DSL with Racket—<a href="http://pollenpub.com/">Pollen</a>—has improved my life tremendously. I want others to share the joy. To do that, however, I’ve had to forget what I already knew about making DSLs, and confront a few rough edges within Racket’s <tt>#lang</tt>-making apparatus. Of course, I’m a better person for it.

Yet, nearly all languages created with Racket are untyped, ignoring the significant typed portion of the PL spectrum. Typed Racket demonstrates that creating typed languages in Racket is possible ... with monumental effort. This talk attempts to give hope to the common Racket programmer who wishes to create typed languages with Racket, yet does not possess multiple PhDs. Specifically, I’ll demonstrate a technique for embedding type checking directly into macro definitions, in a manner that is compatible with the language-creation patterns that Racket programmers are already familiar with, thus leading to typed languages with little effort.</p><div class="bio"><a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/stchang/">Stephen Chang</a> is a research scientist at Northeastern University who uses Racket to help him explore programming language designs and implementations. <a href="https://github.com/AlexKnauth">Alex Knauth</a> is a computer science and physics major, also at Northeastern, who loves using Racket and Typed Racket in his pursuit of learning.

One member of our team developed a new method for applying WP methods to software, and has used it successfully to find nearly intractable bugs in operating systems and other software. We’re automating the method and incorporating the new Micron Automata Process to make it possible to apply our approach to million-line programs. To prove the concept, we have implemented the method in Racket, using Syntax as the intermediate language before conversion to Dijkstra Guarded Commands, and using the Syntax Browser to examine and debug the multiple representations used to convert a programming language into mathematical logic.</p><div class="bio"><a href="https://twitter.com/daviesaz">Byron Davies</a> has been programming in Lisp for 42 years, at Caltech, MIT, Stanford, Texas Instruments, Motorola, and a host of start-ups.

The formats were revolutionary in the 1980s, but now, though compact and commonplace, they are not as easy to work with as more modern general purpose formats used in other disciplines. In order to see what’s in these files, decoders have been written with APIs in Fortran, C and Python, but those decoders, now in beta, require programs that use them to expect input files to be of a specific subtype. Even the Python interface, which offers some amount of interactive and scripting potential, expects a person to have some knowledge of the structure and contents in advance.</p><p>Racket offers the additional capability of using customizable domain specific language to truly explore these files interactively, discovering properties, querying them, transforming data into a variety of formats, and sharing those data with other programs in real time, e.g., for visualization and for use in functional streaming data pipelines.</p><div class="bio"><a href="http://knauth.org/gsk/">Geoffrey Knauth</a> is a Senior Software Developer at AccuWeather.
